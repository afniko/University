# University CRM
Customer relationship management for university. Accounting students, teachers and groups, faculty, departments, auditories, subjects. Forming timetable items. 

## Usage

### Approaches to deployment
Project has two approaches to deployment.
The first one located in 'master' branch. It combines tomcat and H2 DB as one part, and it starts (deploy) together. DB is H2-file type.
The second one located in 'docker_postgres' branch. It approaches based on deployment two separate part for tomcat and postgres DB. DB is Postgres type.

### Compile project
For compile project put files in folder "src/main/java" Use next command in command line:
```
mvn compile
```

### Create execute jar 
For create execute jar file and type in the following command and hit "Enter" Then get jar file
```
mvn clean install
```

### Tests and validate checkstyle
For starting checkstyle audit 
Use command and get "Success" (Audit done)!
```
mvn validate
```
For test use command and get "Success"! During testing use DB H2 in memory type.
```
mvn test
```
For starting integration tests, unit tests and checkstyle audit.
Use command and get "Success"!
During testing use DB H2 in memory type.
```
mvn verify
```
## Database
Database should be Postgres ver 10 or later.
Login and password in application.properties file.
If you use docker-compose deployment then you could use external connection to DB.
Use the next parameters for external connection to DB:
```
POSTGRES_DB: "univer_db"
POSTGRES_USER: "afniko"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "test_pwd"
POSTGRES_HOST: //localhost:54321
```

## Libraries
Use libraries from maven pom.xml file. 

### Run project
For run project type following command by maven.
#### Attention! In this way should use external Postgres DB ver 10 or later. And set actual DB connection parameters by application.properties file.
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
For run project type following command by console
```
java -jar task-university-java11-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Link to start on localhost in web browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```
### REST interface
REST API in JSON format
 
### Swagger
For display Swagger documentation for the REST interface go to
link at swagger page: 
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
## Docker
For build and deployment by Docker should use general commands for Docker-compose:
```
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up --build
docker-compose up
docker-compose down
```
After deployment will expose:
```
tomcat port:8080
postgres port:54321
```
## System test
For testing system by Bash script up docker version and start bash script.
Script create POST and GET requests to the system.
```
./bash_integration_test.sh
```

## System Requirements
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher
